# AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Project Description
A Machine Learning application that identifies network intrusions using the Random Forest Algorithm. This project was developed as the Final Project for the VOIS & Edunet Foundation (AICTE) Cybersecurity Internship.

## Technologies Used
* Python 3.12
* Streamlit (Dashboard UI)
* Scikit-Learn (AI Model)
* Pandas/NumPy (Data Processing)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app: `streamlit run nids_main.py`
